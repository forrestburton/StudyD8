# StudyD8 
(In Progress)
An Android application which helps college students find study partners in classes. Built on Android Studio. I mainly focused on the backend functionality of the app rather than the look so if anyone experienced in UI/UX design wants to clean it up please contact me

•	Utilized data verification to implement user authentication and client-side login

•	Successfully stored and processed user data to create student matches

•	Created a search feature to help users find specific universities and classes
